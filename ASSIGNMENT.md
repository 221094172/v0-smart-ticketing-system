# Assignment 2 — Smart Public Transport Ticketing System

**Course:** Distributed Systems and Applications (DSA612S)  
**Assessment:** Second Assignment — Group Project  
**Released:** 19 September 2025  
**Deadline:** 05 October 2025, 23:59  
**Total Marks:** 100

## Overview & Learning Objectives

This assignment asks you to design and implement a distributed smart public-transport ticketing system (buses & trains). The goal is to practise real-world distributed systems skills: microservices architecture, event-driven communication using Kafka, persistent storage (MongoDB or SQL), containerisation, and orchestration (Docker Compose or Kubernetes).

By the end of the assignment students should be able to:
- Design and implement microservices with clear boundaries and APIs
- Apply event-driven design using Kafka topics and producers/consumers
- Model and persist data in a database and reason about consistency trade-offs
- Containerise services and orchestrate them for multi-service deployment
- Demonstrate testing, monitoring, and fault-tolerance strategies for distributed systems

## Event Flow

### Ticket Purchase Flow
1. Passenger creates ticket → `ticket.requests` topic
2. Payment Service processes payment
3. Payment confirmation → `payments.processed` topic
4. Ticketing Service updates ticket to PAID
5. Ticket status update → `ticket.status` topic
6. Notification Service notifies passenger

### Ticket Validation Flow
1. Validator validates ticket
2. Ticketing Service checks validity
3. Ticket status updated to VALIDATED
4. Status update → `ticket.status` topic
5. Notification Service notifies passenger

### Schedule Update Flow
1. Admin publishes disruption → `schedule.updates` topic
2. Notification Service receives update
3. Affected passengers notified

## Testing

Run the complete system test:

\`\`\`bash
chmod +x scripts/test-system.sh
./scripts/test-system.sh
\`\`\`

This script demonstrates:
- Service health checks
